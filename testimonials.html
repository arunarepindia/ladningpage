					I approached Life & Wellness Co. because of a personal introduction to Connie Sayal. When I learned of the inspiration for the project, and then had the pleasure of meeting with her in person, I realized this service could change my life and others around the world.
				</p>
				<p class="description">
					Life & Wellness Co. helped me by making the travel arrangements incredibly fluid. From support with the visa application to introductions to practitioners, every detail came together in a perfect way.
				</p>
				<p class="description">
					The result was greater than could ever be expected.
				</p>
				<p class="description">
					One thing I liked was their continuity, consideration, and total caring that my experience would be positive and profound...which is was.
				</p>
				<p class="description">
					I found the experience to be life-changing. Valuable healing and insight was created by the perfect between Life & Wellness Co., AyurVAID, and myself.
				</p>
				<p class="description">
					I would recommend Life & Wellness Co. to people who need (or rather desire) a greater experience of life. Their service is a rare offering in a transformational time.

				<p class="description">
					Last year I was diagnosed with diabetes, high blood pressure and severe sleep apnea. I was 50 lbs over weight and was holding a lot of fluid in my body which I could not bring under control with confusing, conflicting diet restrictions and or exercise. I went the western medical model route with prescribed medications for diabetes and high blood pressure. I took part in a sleep study where they sent me home with a breathing machine which only made things worse. Nothing made any significant difference and I was becoming very frustrated.  Then I was introduced to Life & Wellness Co. and to Ayurvedic medicine by a friend of mine. I was completely unfamiliar with this approach to healing and had no expectations whatsoever.
				</p>
				<p class="description">
					Life & Wellness Co. helped connect me with Ayurvaid Domlur Hospital in Bangalore India, specializing in diabetes.
				</p>
				<p class="description">
					The result was amazing!  Over the course of my 3 week stay under the strict supervision of the doctors I watched my health transform. They monitored my diet, my sleep and gave me daily ayurvedic herbal medicines and body treatments. My blood sugar went from nearly 300 to 118. The drop was consistent, not spiking and dropping. Each day I watched the fluid in my body drain and I lost 13 lbs. My sleep improved and by the end of my stay I went from only sleeping a couple of hours at a time and waking with headaches to sleeping through the night and waking feeling rested.
				</p>
				<p class="description">
					I was so impressed by the doctors and their staff. They were available and involved. Their follow up was impeccable and their kindness was a medicine missing from most conventional hospitals and treatments. Once the doctor and his staff even took me shopping at a local store and helped me pick out an outfit to wear to a wedding I was to attend. I think they were more excited than I was.
				</p>
				<p class="description">
					This experience was truly life changing. If you had told me a year ago that I would go to India to get my health back I would have told you you were crazy. Now I am looking forward to getting my life back on track. I feel confident that I can manage and maintain my health based on the program these doctors set in motion for me. Since I’ve been home I’ve lost another 5 lbs. The response from other people has been overwhelmingly positive and encouraging.
				</p>
				<p class="description">
					I would recommend Life & Wellness Co. to people who need feel like they have tried everything and nothings working and who are open to truly changing their health.
