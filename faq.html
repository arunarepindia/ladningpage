				Our long term vision at the Life and Wellness Co. is that more and more people move towards preventative healthcare and are able to understand the importance of creating a healthy lifestyle. We believe this is possible through the type of treatment you choose to go for: executive health check-up or a wellness program. 
			</p>

			<div class="term">HOW DOES IT WORK?</div>
			<div class="desc">
				After you contact us and tell us about your health issues, we set up a phone consultation between you and the Doctor to develop a treatment. After you confirm your treatment and travel dates, we help you organise your entire trip, from flights to airport transfers, local transport and where needed, sightseeing tours and accommodation.
				<ol type="a">
					<li>
						PLANNING STAGE
						<ul>
							<li>
								You get in touch with us and share details of your health conditions.
							</li>
							<li>

							</li>
							<li>
								You confirm treatment plan and finalise departure date.
							</li>
							<li>
								We help you with your flight tickets &amp; Visa, and any other issues.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						TRAVEL - You fly to a destination that has been chosen by you. We arrange an airport pickup, and take you to the hospital directly, where we help you check in.
					</li>
					<li>
						HOSPITAL TIME - Total Days specified by the health care provider.
					</li>
					<li>
						RETURN HOME - Fly back home. We help you check out of the hospital and see you off at the airport.
					</li>
				</ol>
			</div>

			<div class="term">WHAT IS A TREAMENT PLAN?</div>
			<div class="desc">
				Essentially, a treatment plan is a personalised plan. The health care providers request access to your medical records in order to make an assessment to prescribe a treatment best suited to your need.
			</div>

			<div class="term">HOW LONG IS THE TREATMENT?</div>
			<div class="desc">
				This would depend entirely on you, your time constraints, your health conditions and the treatment plan prescribed. The health care providers are the best judge once your medical records are reviewed.
			</div>

			<div class="term">HOW MUCH DOES IT COST?</div>
			<div class="desc">
				Once again, this would depend on your treatment plan. Get in touch with us, and based on your individual needs, we will develop a treatment plan with costs for you.
			</div>

			<div class="term">WHERE IS THE CLINIC?</div>
			<div class="desc">
				Through our portal we give you access to doctors that specialize in different fields of medicine. It allows you to further navigate where you wish to be treated by city &amp; country.
			</div>

			<div class="term">WHEN IS THE BEST TIME TO GO?</div>
			<div class="desc">
				We believe that the best time to go is NOW! Why wait – Health issues are best addressed at the earliest.
			</div>

			<div class="term">CAN I GO SIGHTSEEING WHILE I AM THERE?</div>
			<div class="desc">
				We understand that while in India some of you may like to visit some sights of cultural or historical importance in the area. While this may be possible during your free time at the hospital, the doctors generally prefer that the patients do not exert themselves during their treatment period. However a journey can always be arranged post recovery from your medical treatment.
			</div>

			<div class="term">WHAT IS THE ACCOMMODATION LIKE?</div>
			<div class="desc">
				There are two options for accommodation:<br>
				Health Care Providers: Hospitals &amp; Clinics have different categories of rooms. They cater to your budget &amp; additional requirements. This is left to our client’s discretion completely as to which type of accommodation they choose from.
			</div>

			<div class="term">WHAT IS THE FOOD LIKE?</div>
			<div class="desc">
				At different destinations health care providers have different foods. A lot depends on the daily dietary requirements that are prescribed by a nutritionist for you.

				WHAT IS AN AYURVEDIC TREATMENT PLAN?
			</div>
			<div class="desc">
				Essentially, a treatment plan is a personalised integrated therapy. Ayurveda treats the root cause of any health condition. Depending on your health condition, the plan would recommend a combination of diet, lifestyle, medication and deep cleansing therapies.

			</div>

			<div class="term">
				HOW LONG IS THE TREATMENT?
			</div>
			<div class="desc">
				This would depend entirely on you, your time constraints, your health conditions and the
				treatment plan you choose. We recommend a treatment of minimum of two weeks for any treatment.
			</div>

			<div class="term">
				HOW MUCH DOES IT COST?
			</div>
			<div class="desc">
				Once again, this would depend on your treatment plan. Get in touch with us, and based on your individual needs, we will develop a treatment plan with costs for you.
			</div>

			<div class="term">
				IS THERE A DAILY ROUTINE AT THE HOSPITAL?
			</div>
			<div class="desc">
				On your first day at the hospital you will be given a full consultation and customized health assessment based on your individual needs. Based on this assessment, you will have two or three treatments per day. Apart from this you will have time to rest and relax.
			</div>

			<div class="term">
				WHERE IS THE CLINIC?
			</div>
			<div class="desc">
				The Clinic is located in Bangalore, or ‘Bengaluru’ as it is now officially known. It is the capital of the southern Indian state of Karnataka.
			</div>

			<div class="term">
				WHEN IS THE BEST TIME TO GO?
			</div>
			<div class="desc">
				We believe that the best time to go is NOW! Why wait – Health issues are best addressed at
				the earliest. Besides, unlike other cities in India, Bangalore is known for its pleasant climate all year round, with average highs of about 30 Celsius.
			</div>

			<div class="term">
				CAN I GO SIGHTSEEING WHILE I AM THERE?
			</div>
			<div class="desc">
				We understand that while in India some of you may like to visit some sights of cultural or historical importance in the area. While this may be possible during your free time at the hospital, the doctors generally prefer that the patients do not exert themselves during their treatment period. Some of our clients prefer to stay on in Bangalore for a few days after their treatment is over, to sightsee. If you would prefer to do this, we would be happy to arrange tours, local travel and accommodation for you.
			</div>

			<div class="term">
				WHAT IS THE ACCOMODATION LIKE?
			</div>
			<div class="desc">
				There are two options for accommodation:
				<ol type="1">
					<li>
						At the Clinic: The clinic has simple, neat and clean hospital-like rooms. Each room has a TV and free WIFI, with nurses on call.
					</li>
					<li>
						At the Retreat: The country style retreat has more luxurious rooms which are attached to a boutique hotel. Each room has a TV and free WIFI, with nurses on call. Clients who choose to stay at the Retreat have access to other hotel facilities including the swimming pool, salon and tennis court.
					</li>
				</ol>
			</div>

			<div class="term">
				WHAT IS THE FOOD LIKE?
			</div>
			<div class="desc">
				During your Ayurveda treatment you will be served food according to your dietary
				requirements based on your health conditions. Only simple, wholesome and nutritious Indian vegetarian food is served during your treatment.
			</div>

			<div class="term">
				WHAT IS AYURVEDA?
			</div>
			<div class="desc">
				Ayurveda, one of the oldest medicine systems in the world, dates back approximately 5000 years ago and has its origin in the Indus Valley Civilization. Ayurveda comes from a Sanskrit word – 'Ayu', which means life and 'Veda', knowledge - Ayurveda is thus, the 'Knowledge of Life'. According to Ayurveda’s guiding principle, health is not synonymous to just absence of diseases, but is also about an individual’s immunity and peace of mind that enables him or her to counter ailments and disorders.
			</div>

			<div class="term">
				WHAT DISEASES CAN AYURVEDA TREAT?
			</div>
			<div class="desc">
				Ayurveda can successfully balance symptoms and root causes of a large number of diseases. We encourage you to contact us with your medical problems so that we may set up a telephonic consultation for you with an ayurvedic physician. Some of the problems that Ayurveda works to cure including the following:
				<br>
